# Project M
BTM 380: Database Management.
 
Final project submission in 2019.
MySql project to emulate a music streaming service database and its data models. 

 
	Following Query ask:

1.	Display the number of months since a customer has begun using the music streaming service

This query displays the number of months since a customer has begun using the streaming service and the number of invoiced associated to a customer. This query is important to calculate cash flows.

2. 	Display the most recent song played by ever user id.

This query shows the most recent song played by ever user id. Recency is important in this case to conduct an RFM analysis.

3.	Display the monthly churn rate for paid users 

This query displays the percentage rate at which the customers stop subscribing to a service. In a period from February to November, we didn’t gain or lose customers. We had an average of 0.

4.	Display the average LTV per paid user

The LTV is the Life Time Value of a customer which tells us how much an user contributed to the revenue over the course of his whole life, since the moment he joined the service to the moment he left.

5.	Display the free, platinum and gold turnover in days

	5.1  This query displays the number of days that free subscribers remain in service and the number of days they are no longer free user.

	5.2 This query displays the number of days that gold subscribers remain in service and the number of days they are no longer gold user.

	5.3  This query displays the number of days that plat subscribers remain in service and the number of days they are no longer platinum user. 

6.	Display the daily average ad revenue per customer

This query is self explanatory. 

7.	Display the Total Revenue per user including the amount from subscription as well as advertisement 
This query takes into account the revenue generated from subscriptions as well as the advertisements. 

8.	Display the total revenue per user and 1 for above average, 0 for below average

This queries tells us if the revenue that the customers contributed is above average or below

9.	Display the RFM score for every user

This query displays the RFM score for every user. RFM is a strategy for estimating the value of a customer, based on three factors:
    • Recency (How recently did the customer make a purchase?)
      -     Frequency (How often does a customer make a purchase?)
      -     Monetary Value (How much do they spend? )

10.	Display the summary for every subscription such as their start date, end date and the total revenue generated for every type of subscriptions

This group of queries is self-explanatory. It is important because it shows us many different aspects of profitability.

10.1 Display start date, end date and the revenue stream from free subscriber.

10.2 Display start date, end date and the revenue stream from gold subscriber.

10.3 Display start date, end date and the revenue stream from platinum subscriber.
